# Idea: Explicit Fine-Grained Numbering in Vision

## Requirement
The L0 Vision must explicitly state that *every* sentence/statement must be numbered for granularity.

## Rationale
"Traceability" is vague. We need to define the *granularity* of traceability.
It's not enough to trace to a Section. We must trace to a specific Line/Statement (`1.`, `2.`).

## Changes
Update `VISION.TRACEABILITY` in `L0-VISION.md`.
