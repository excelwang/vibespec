# Idea: Final Compilation Protocol

## Requirement
Perform a final compilation of all specs into a single authoritative document `VIBE-SPECS.md`.

## Steps
1.  Run `scripts/compile.sh` (or emulate logic).
2.  Verify the output document maps all L0-L3 content.
3.  LLM review 
4.  Human review
5.  Commit those specs as the "Specs-V{id}" for this session.

## Outcome
A single file that can be distributed or fed into other agents as a complete context.
