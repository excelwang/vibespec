# L0: Vision

## Goal
Describe the high-level goal of your system here.

## Non-Goals
- What you validly decided NOT to do.

## VISION.TARGET_PROJECT
- **MAINTAINABILITY**: Code is read more than written; clarity over cleverness.
- **OBSERVABILITY**: If you cannot see it, assume it is broken.
- **DETERMINISM**: Stochastic behavior is a bug unless explicitly required.
- **MODULARITY**: High cohesion within modules, low coupling between them.
