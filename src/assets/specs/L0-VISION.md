## [standard] VISION.PHILOSOPHY

> Core principles guiding the project.

1. **MAINTAINABILITY**: Code is read more than written; clarity over cleverness.
2. **OBSERVABILITY**: If you cannot see it, assume it is broken.
3. **DETERMINISM**: Stochastic behavior is a bug unless explicitly required.
4. **MODULARITY**: High cohesion within modules, low coupling between them.
