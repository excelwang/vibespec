# L0: Vision

## VISION.SCOPE

> **Guidance**: Define what the system IS (In-Scope) and what it IS NOT (Out-of-Scope).

### In-Scope
1. **[Core Capability 1]**: [Description of key functionality]
2. **[Core Capability 2]**: [Description of key functionality]

### Out-of-Scope
1. **[Constraint 1]**: [What we will explicitly NOT do]
2. **[Constraint 2]**: [Delegated responsibilities]

## VISION.PHILOSOPHY

> **Guidance**: Define the non-negotiable architectural principles.

1. **MAINTAINABILITY**: Code is read more than written; clarity over cleverness.
2. **OBSERVABILITY**: If you cannot see it, assume it is broken.
3. **DETERMINISM**: Stochastic behavior is a bug unless explicitly required.
4. **MODULARITY**: High cohesion within modules, low coupling between them.
