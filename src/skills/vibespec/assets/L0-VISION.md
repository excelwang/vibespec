# L0: {{PROJECT_NAME}} Vision

> **Core Purpose**: Define the strategic vision that guides all lower layers (L1-L3).
> All spec statements must trace back to items defined here.

---

## VISION.SCOPE

{{PROJECT_NAME}} is a [describe what it IS].

### In-Scope
- **CAPABILITY_1**: [Description of key functionality]
- **CAPABILITY_2**: [Description of key functionality]
- **CAPABILITY_3**: [Description of key functionality]

### Out-of-Scope
- **EXCLUSION_1**: [What we will explicitly NOT do]
- **EXCLUSION_2**: [Delegated responsibilities]

## VISION.CODE_QUALITY_GOALS

Specs generated by {{PROJECT_NAME}} should guide agents to generate code with:

| Quality | Definition | Verification |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **MAINTAINABILITY** | Clarity over cleverness. Modular, readable, low coupling. | Code review, static analysis |
| **OBSERVABILITY** | If you can't see it, assume it's broken. Logs, metrics, traces. | Monitoring coverage |
| **DETERMINISM** | Stochastic behavior is a bug unless required. Reproducible results. | Test repeatability |
| **MODULARITY** | High cohesion, low coupling. Single responsibility. | Dependency analysis |

---

## VISION.AUTOMATION

- **SCRIPT_FIRST**: Prefer deterministic scripts over LLM for mechanical tasks.
- **COGNITIVE_LOAD**: Minimize human decisions; batch related items.
- **EVOLUTION**: Rigidify patterns into scripts as they become understood.
- **ITEM_CLASSIFICATION**: Tag L3 items with type (interface/decision/algorithm/workflow).

---

## VISION.CERTIFICATION

- **COMPLIANCE**: Validate that agents correctly execute L1 Agent contracts and L3 Role decisions.
- **PROOF**: Generate certification artifacts (answer_keys, test_papers) to prove compliance.

---

## VISION.TRACEABILITY

- **CHAIN**: Every implementation traces to L3 → L2 → L1 → L0.
- **REFS**: Cross-references use `(Ref: PARENT.ITEM)` format.
- **GRANULARITY**: Every spec statement is atomically addressable.
- **GOAL**: Every line of code satisfies a requirement.

---

## VISION.VIBE_CODING

- **TRUTH**: Specs are the primary source of truth; code follows spec.
- **PARADIGM**: Human defines Spec → AI writes code → Human & AI verify.
- **HUMAN_GATE**: Human approval required before persisting spec changes.
- **SHIFT_LEFT**: Catch errors at spec level, not implementation.

---

## VISION.PHILOSOPHY

- **HUMAN_CENTRIC**: Produce atomic, readable specs for humans.
- **LLM_CENTRIC**: Generate concise, deterministic prompts for AI.
- **SYSTEM_CENTRIC**: Manage complexity via scripts.
- **SEPARATION**: Strictly separate Agent (semantic) from Script (mechanical) work.

---

## VISION.FORMAL_SYNTAX

- **PRECISION_OVER_PROSE**: Prioritize formal notation over prose where applicable.
- **FORMALISMS**: Use Mermaid diagrams, JSON/Code schemas, pseudocode.
- **MULTIPLIER**: Leverage high-density formal blocks for clarity.

---

## VISION.UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE

Use precise, unambiguous terminology across all specs:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Validate | Structural/static checks by scripts |
| Verify | Dynamic/runtime checks by tests |
| Assert | Hard blocking condition in code |
| Pipeline | Linear sequence of steps |
| Flow | Branching logic path |
| Violation | Breaking a spec rule |
| Error | Runtime crash or exception |
