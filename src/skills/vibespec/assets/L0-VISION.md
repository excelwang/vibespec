# L0: {{PROJECT_NAME}} Vision

> **CRITICAL AGENT INSTRUCTION**: Substantive vision requirements (statements with IDs like **VAL**, **TRACE**, **COMPLIANCE**) MUST ONLY be placed under H3 (`###`) headings (e.g. `### VISION.SECURITY`). H2 (`##`) headings are strictly for short chapter titles (e.g., `## Context`, `## Security`). Do NOT place any bullet points or substantive text directly under an H2 heading.

> **Core Purpose**: Define the strategic vision that guides all lower layers (L1-L3).
> All spec statements must trace back to items defined here.

{{PROJECT_NAME}} is a [describe what it IS].

## In-Scope
- **VAL**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to [core capability 1]
- **TRACE**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to [core capability 2]

## Out-of-Scope
- **NON_GOAL**: User does NOT want {{PROJECT_NAME}} to [explicit non-goal]

## Code Quality

### VISION.CODE_QUALITY_GOALS

User wants specs generated by {{PROJECT_NAME}} to guide agents to generate code with:

| Quality | Definition | Verification |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **MAINTAINABILITY** | Clarity over cleverness. Modular, readable, low coupling. | Code review, static analysis |
| **OBSERVABILITY** | If you can't see it, assume it's broken. Logs, metrics, traces. | Monitoring coverage |
| **DETERMINISM** | Stochastic behavior is a bug unless required. Reproducible results. | Test repeatability |
| **MODULARITY** | High cohesion, low coupling. Single responsibility. | Dependency analysis |

## Automation

### VISION.AUTOMATION

- **SCRIPT_FIRST**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to script any formalizable task.
- **COGNITIVE_LOAD**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to minimize LLM/human cognitive load via deterministic systems.
- **EVOLUTION**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to evolve by rigidifying patterns into code.
- **EXECUTION_TYPES**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to clearly distinguish between deterministic Systems and stochastic Agents.

## Certification

### VISION.CERTIFICATION

- **COMPLIANCE**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to validate that agents correctly execute L1 Agent Acceptance and L3 Role Decisions.
- **PROOF**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to generate certification artifacts to prove compliance.

## Extensibility

### VISION.EXTENSIBILITY

- **PROJECT_RULES**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to allow project-specific validation rules.
- **RULE_LOCATION**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to define custom rules in L1-CONTRACTS.
- **CORE_VS_CUSTOM**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to separate universal rules from project-specific ones.

---

## Traceability

### VISION.TRACEABILITY

- **CHAIN**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to support full traceability from request to verified code.
- **GRANULARITY**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to make every spec statement atomically addressable.
- **GOAL**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to ensure every line of code satisfies a requirement.

## Vibe Coding

### VISION.VIBE_CODING

- **TRUTH**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to treat `specs/` as the primary source of truth.
- **PARADIGM**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to enable: Human defines Spec ↔ AI writes Code ↔ Human & AI verify.
- **HUMAN_GATE**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to require human approval before persisting spec changes.
- **SHIFT_LEFT**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to catch errors at spec level, not implementation.

## Philosophy

### VISION.PHILOSOPHY

- **HUMAN_CENTRIC**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to produce atomic, readable specs.
- **LLM_CENTRIC**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to generate concise, deterministic prompts.
- **SYSTEM_CENTRIC**: Manage complexity via systems (see AUTOMATION.SCRIPT_FIRST).
- **SEPARATION**: Strictly separate Agent (semantic) from System (mechanical) work.

## Agent as Developer

### VISION.AGENT_AS_DEVELOPER

- **PRIMARY_CONSUMER**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to compile a "Developer's Bible" for AI agents.
- **FULL_CONTEXT**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to provide AI with "God's Eye View" of internals.

## Spec Structure

### VISION.SPEC_STRUCTURE

- **DIRECTORY_BASED**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to treat `specs/` directory as the source of truth.
- **INDIVIDUAL_FILES**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to maintain separate L0-L3 files for modularity.

## Formal Syntax

### VISION.FORMAL_SYNTAX

- **PRECISION_OVER_PROSE**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to prioritize formal notation over prose.
- **FORMALISMS**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to use Mermaid, JSON/Code schemas, pseudocode.
- **MULTIPLIER**: User wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to leverage high-density formal blocks for clarity.

## Ubiquitous Language

### VISION.UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE

Use precise, unambiguous terminology across all specs:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Validate | Structural/static checks |
| Verify | Dynamic/runtime checks |
| Audit | Objective compliance check against the 'Law' (L1) |
| Draft | Unverified or work-in-progress specification |
| Assert | Hard blocking condition in code |
| Violation | Breaking a spec rule |
| Error | Runtime crash or exception |
