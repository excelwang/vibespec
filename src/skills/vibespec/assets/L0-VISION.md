# L0: {{PROJECT_NAME}} Vision

> **Core Purpose**: Define the strategic vision that guides all lower layers (L1-L3).
> All spec statements must trace back to items defined here.

## VISION.SCOPE

{{PROJECT_NAME}} is a [describe what it IS].

### In-Scope
- **VAL**: [e.g., Validate specs hierarchically (L0-L3)]
- **TRACE**: [e.g., Track layer dependencies for traceability]
- **COV**: [e.g., Track test-to-spec coverage via @verify_spec]

### Out-of-Scope
- **LLM**: [What we explicitly NOT do, e.g., generate code]
- **PM**: [Non-goals, e.g., manage project tickets]

## VISION.CODE_QUALITY_GOALS

Specs generated by {{PROJECT_NAME}} should guide agents to generate code with:

| Quality | Definition | Verification |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **MAINTAINABILITY** | Clarity over cleverness. Modular, readable, low coupling. | Code review, static analysis |
| **OBSERVABILITY** | If you can't see it, assume it's broken. Logs, metrics, traces. | Monitoring coverage |
| **DETERMINISM** | Stochastic behavior is a bug unless required. Reproducible results. | Test repeatability |
| **MODULARITY** | High cohesion, low coupling. Single responsibility. | Dependency analysis |

## VISION.AUTOMATION

- **SCRIPT_FIRST**: Prefer deterministic scripts over LLM for mechanical tasks.
- **COGNITIVE_LOAD**: Minimize human decisions; batch related items.
- **EVOLUTION**: Rigidify patterns into scripts as they become understood.

## VISION.TRACEABILITY

- **CHAIN**: Every implementation traces to L3 → L2 → L1 → L0.
- **GRANULARITY**: Every spec statement is atomically addressable.
- **GOAL**: Every line of code satisfies a requirement.

## VISION.VIBE_CODING

- **TRUTH**: Specs are the primary source of truth; code follows spec.
- **PARADIGM**: Human defines Spec → AI writes code → Human & AI verify.
- **HUMAN_GATE**: Human approval required before persisting spec changes.
- **SHIFT_LEFT**: Catch errors at spec level, not implementation.

## VISION.PHILOSOPHY

- **HUMAN_CENTRIC**: Produce atomic, readable specs for humans.
- **LLM_CENTRIC**: Generate concise, deterministic prompts for AI.
- **SYSTEM_CENTRIC**: Manage complexity via scripts.
- **SEPARATION**: Strictly separate Agent (semantic) from Script (mechanical) work.

## VISION.FORMAL_SYNTAX

- **PRECISION_OVER_PROSE**: Prioritize formal notation over prose.
- **FORMALISMS**: Use Mermaid, JSON/Code schemas, pseudocode.
- **MULTIPLIER**: Leverage high-density formal blocks for clarity.

## VISION.UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE

Use precise, unambiguous terminology across all specs:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Validate | Structural/static checks (客观/机械校验) |
| Verify | Dynamic/runtime checks (运行时验证) |
| Audit | Objective compliance check against the 'Law' (L1) |
| Draft | Unverified or work-in-progress specification |
| Assert | Hard blocking condition in code |
| Violation | Breaking a spec rule |
| Error | Runtime crash or exception |
