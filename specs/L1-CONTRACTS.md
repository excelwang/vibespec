  > Verification: Tests include edge cases and common misuse patterns.
  (Ref: VISION.CERTIFICATION.COMPLIANCE)

- **COMBINE_QUESTION_PAPER**: Script MUST combine all answer_key files and strip answers to generate `question_paper.md`.
  > Responsibility: Assessment — produce unified exam from individual answer keys.
  > Verification: `tests/specs/agent/question_paper.md` contains all items with blank answers.
  (Ref: VISION.CERTIFICATION.PROOF)

- **REALISTIC_CONTEXT**: Agent MUST use realistic Context/Expectation content matching actual project inputs.
  > Responsibility: Relevance — test scenarios must reflect real user/script inputs, not placeholders.
  > Verification: answer_key files contain concrete, project-specific examples.
  (Ref: VISION.CERTIFICATION.COMPLIANCE)

- **CONTEXTUAL_SCENARIO**: Vibespec MUST analyze project context to generate and execute a relevant End-to-End Scenario.
  > Responsibility: Relevance — prove toolchain works on *this* project.
  > Verification: Generated scenario matches project domain (e.g., User vs. Order).
  (Ref: VISION.TRACEABILITY.CHAIN)

## CONTRACTS.MAINTENANCE

- **BUG_RCA**: On `vibespec bug`, Agent MUST trace failures recursively from L3 to L0 to find the root cause spec item.
  > Responsibility: Depth — find the true origin.
  > Verification: RCA trace log shows upward traversal.
  (Ref: VISION.VIBE_CODING.SHIFT_LEFT)

- **RECURSIVE_FIX**: Agent MUST verify proposed spec fixes against parent layers (Upward) before cascading changes (Downward).
  > Responsibility: Integrity — prevent local fixes from breaking global contracts.
  > Verification: Fix proposal includes parent compliance check.
  (Ref: VISION.TRACEABILITY.CHAIN)

- **DELETION_JUSTIFICATION**: Agent MUST document the reason for any L1-L3 item deletion and request review.
  > Responsibility: Safety — prevent accidental regression or scope creep (deletion is scope change).
  > Verification: User approval prompt contains "Motivation: [reason]" for deleted items.
  (Ref: VISION.TRACEABILITY.CHAIN)

## CONTRACTS.RELOAD

- **RELOAD_TRIGGER**: When user inputs `vibespec reload`, Agent MUST re-read SKILL.md.
  > Responsibility: Hot-reload — apply skill changes without restarting session.
  > Verification: Agent confirms SKILL.md re-loaded after trigger.
  (Ref: VISION.AUTOMATION.EVOLUTION)

## CONTRACTS.TEMPLATE_GENERATION

- **USE_TEMPLATES**: Agent MUST use templates from `src/assets/specs/` when generating files.
  > Responsibility: Consistency — ensure uniform formatting across all generated specs.
  > Verification: Generated files match template structure.
  (Ref: VISION.PHILOSOPHY)

- **TEMPLATE_FILES**: Templates MUST include: IDEA_TEMPLATE.md, L0-VISION.md, L1-CONTRACTS.md, L2-ARCHITECTURE.md, L3-IMPLEMENTATION.md.
  > Responsibility: Completeness — provide templates for all spec types.
  > Verification: All template files exist in `src/assets/specs/`.
  (Ref: VISION.TRACEABILITY.CHAIN)

## CONTRACTS.STARTUP_MENU

- **INTERACTIVE_START**: When user runs `vibespec` (no args), Agent MUST display capabilities menu and wait for input.
  > Responsibility: Control — prevent accidental execution of pending workloads.
  > Verification: Agent outputs usage help and stops execution.
  (Ref: VISION.PHILOSOPHY.HUMAN_CENTRIC)

- **FIRST_RUN_COMPREHENSION**: On first `vibespec` invocation, Agent MUST read all L0-L3 specs before executing.
  > Responsibility: Context — ensure deep project understanding before action.
  > Verification: Agent summarizes project understanding before proceeding.
  (Ref: VISION.AGENT_AS_DEVELOPER.FULL_CONTEXT)

---


## CONTRACTS.AUTOMATE_MODE

- **AUTOMATE_TRIGGER**: When user inputs `vibespec automate`, Agent MUST enter automate mode.
  > Responsibility: Efficiency — enable hands-off batch processing.
  > Verification: Agent processes all ideas without human approval gates.
  (Ref: VISION.AUTOMATION.COGNITIVE_LOAD)

- **AUTO_ACCEPT**: In automate mode, Agent MUST auto-accept own suggestions.
  > Responsibility: Speed — skip approval delays for routine changes.
  > Verification: No notify_user calls with BlockedOnUser=true.
  (Ref: VISION.AUTOMATION.SCRIPT_FIRST)

- **AUTO_FIX_WARNINGS**: In automate mode, Agent MUST auto-fix validation warnings.
  > Responsibility: Completeness — resolve all cascade warnings automatically.
  > Verification: Validation passes with 0 warnings after automate completes.
  (Ref: VISION.VIBE_CODING.SHIFT_LEFT)

- **BUILD_BEFORE_TEST**: In automate mode, Agent MUST execute Build phase before Test phase.
  > Responsibility: Validity — tests must run against latest artifacts.
  > Verification: Workflow sequence is Refine → Validate → Compile → Build → Test.
  (Ref: VISION.VIBE_CODING.TRUTH)
