# Idea: L3 Workflow Type

**Timestamp**: 2026-02-08T14:39:11+08:00

## Proposal

Vibe-spec MUST support a new content type in L3: `[workflow]`.
This allows expressing L1 items (contracts) as multi-step workflows in L3, distinct from `[interface]`, `[decision]`, or `[algorithm]`.

## Rationale

- Some L1 contracts (e.g., TEST_GENERATION) imply a sequence of steps, not just a single function or decision.
- `[workflow]` provides a structured way to definition these sequences.

## Target

- L0: Update `VISION.AUTOMATION.ITEM_CLASSIFICATION` (add WORKFLOW)
- L3: Update header (Content Types) and template
