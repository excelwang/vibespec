# Idea: Vibespec Bug Analysis

**Timestamp**: 2026-02-08T16:27:14+08:00

## Proposal

When user inputs `vibespec bug [description]`, the system MUST perform **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** starting from `specs/`.

**Workflow**:
1. **Trace Bug to Spec**: Identify which spec component is responsible for the buggy behavior.
2. **Review Spec**:
   - Is the spec ambiguous?
   - Is the spec incorrect?
   - Is the spec missing coverage (Gap)?
   - Is the implementation drifting from spec (Violation)?
3. **Propose Spec Fix**: Generate an idea file to update the spec, rather than just fixing the code.

## Rationale

- **Shift Left**: Bugs are often spec failures. Fixing code without fixing spec leads to drift.
- **Truth Maintenance**: Ensures `specs/` remains the authoritative source of truth.
- **Learning**: The system learns from mistakes by codifying the fix in specs.

## Target

- **SKILL**: Add `vibespec bug` trigger.
- **L2**: Update `RECOVERY_AGENT` or `INSIGHT_MINER` role.
- **L1**: Add `CONTRACTS.MAINTENANCE.BUG_RCA`.
