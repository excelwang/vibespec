# Idea: Derive Exports from H2 Headings

## Proposal
Remove explicit `exports` list from YAML frontmatter. Instead, **derive exports automatically from H2 headings** (`##`) in the markdown body.

## Current Approach
```yaml
---
exports:
  - CONTRACTS.METADATA_INTEGRITY
  - CONTRACTS.DEPENDENCY_RESOLUTION
---

## CONTRACTS.METADATA_INTEGRITY
...
## CONTRACTS.DEPENDENCY_RESOLUTION
...
```

## Proposed Approach
```yaml
---
layer: 1
id: CONTRACTS
version: 1.0.0
requires:
  - VISION.SCOPE
---

## CONTRACTS.METADATA_INTEGRITY   <- Auto-detected as export
...
## CONTRACTS.DEPENDENCY_RESOLUTION <- Auto-detected as export
...
```

## Benefits
1. **DRY**: No duplication between frontmatter and headings.
2. **Less Error-Prone**: Can't forget to add export or have mismatches.
3. **Simpler Frontmatter**: Fewer fields to maintain.

## Tradeoffs
1. **Implicit vs Explicit**: Exports become implicit, potentially less obvious.
2. **Validation Complexity**: Script must parse markdown body, not just YAML.
3. **Heading Format Constraint**: H2 headings MUST follow `ID.SUBID` pattern.

## Recommendation
**Adopt** if we maintain convention: H2 headings starting with `{SPEC_ID}.` are treated as exports.
