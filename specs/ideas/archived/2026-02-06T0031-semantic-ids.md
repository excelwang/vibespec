# Idea: Semantic IDs & Strict Dangling Checks

## Problem
1.  **Unstable Numbering**: Sequential numbering (`1.`, `2.`) breaks references when items are inserted or reordered.
2.  **Stale Implementations**: If an upstream requirement is deleted, downstream specs referencing it become "zombie" or "redundant" and should be flagged.

## Proposed Changes
1.  **Semantic IDs**: Replace numbered lists with **Bold Keys**.
    -   Old: `1. **Traceability**: ...` -> Ref: `SECTION.1` (Fragile)
    -   New: `- **TRACEABILITY**: ...` -> Ref: `SECTION.TRACEABILITY` (Stable)
2.  **Validator Logic**:
    -   Parse these Keys as valid Exports.
    -   **Dangling Check**: If a downstream item has `(Ref: UPSTREAM.KEY, %)`, and `UPSTREAM.KEY` does not exist, fail validation.
    -   **Redundancy Check**: Warning if an upstream Export has 0% coverage (orphan requirement).

## SECTION
- **KEY_NAME**: Statement text. (Ref: PARENT.KEY, 100%)
```
