# L0: Vibespec Vision

> **Core Purpose**: User wants Vibespec to build specs that guide agents to generate user project source code with **maintainability**, **observability**, **determinism**, and **modularity**.

## VISION.SCOPE

User wants vibespec to be a **specification management framework** (not a code generator).

### In-Scope
- **VAL**: User wants vibespec to validate specs hierarchically (L0-L3).
- **TRACE**: User wants vibespec to track layer dependencies for traceability.
- **COV**: User wants vibespec to track test-to-spec coverage via `@verify_spec`.
- **IDEAS**: User wants vibespec to ingest raw ideas and refine them into specs.
- **REFL**: User wants vibespec to reflect on conversations and extract new ideas.
- **DEPS**: User wants vibespec to operate with zero third-party dependencies.
- **AUTO**: User wants vibespec to automate workflows via scripts first.
- **SKILL**: User wants vibespec to distribute as an agentic skill (SKILL.md).

### Out-of-Scope
- **LLM**: User does NOT want vibespec to generate code (delegated to external agents).
- **UI**: User does NOT want vibespec to provide UI design tools.
- **PM**: User does NOT want vibespec to manage projects or tickets.

## VISION.CODE_QUALITY_GOALS

User wants specs generated by Vibespec to guide agents to generate code with:

| Quality | Definition | Verification |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **MAINTAINABILITY** | Clarity over cleverness. Modular, readable, low coupling. | Code review, static analysis |
| **OBSERVABILITY** | If you can't see it, assume it's broken. Logs, metrics, traces. | Monitoring coverage |
| **DETERMINISM** | Stochastic behavior is a bug unless required. Reproducible results. | Test repeatability |
| **MODULARITY** | High cohesion, low coupling. Single responsibility. | Dependency analysis |

## VISION.AUTOMATION

- **SCRIPT_FIRST**: User wants vibespec to script any formalizable task.
- **COGNITIVE_LOAD**: User wants vibespec to minimize LLM/human cognitive load via deterministic scripts.
- **EVOLUTION**: User wants vibespec to evolve by rigidifying patterns into code.
- **ITEM_CLASSIFICATION**: User wants vibespec to tag L3 items with execution type (PROMPT_NATIVE | SCRIPT | WORKFLOW | PROMPT_FALLBACK).

## VISION.CERTIFICATION

- **COMPLIANCE**: User wants vibespec to validate that agents correctly execute L1 Agent Acceptance and L3 Role Decisions prescribed in `specs/`.
- **PROOF**: User wants vibespec to generate certification artifacts (exams) to prove this compliance.

## VISION.EXTENSIBILITY

- **PROJECT_RULES**: User wants vibespec to allow project-specific validation rules.
- **RULE_LOCATION**: User wants vibespec to define custom rules in L1-CONTRACTS.
- **CORE_VS_CUSTOM**: User wants vibespec to separate universal rules from project-specific ones.
- **SCHEMA_DRIVEN**: User wants vibespec to use declarative schemas for rule definitions.

---

## VISION.TRACEABILITY

- **CHAIN**: User wants vibespec to support full traceability from request to verified code.
- **WORKFLOW**: User wants vibespec to follow: Request → Breakdown → L1 Specs → Implementation → L2/L3 Distillation → Verification.
  > Note: L2/L3 MAY be generated *after* implementation (Code-First) to ensure accuracy.
- **GRANULARITY**: User wants vibespec to make every spec statement atomically addressable.
- **GOAL**: User wants vibespec to ensure every line of code satisfies a requirement.

## VISION.VIBE_CODING

- **TRUTH**: User wants vibespec to treat ideas/ the primary source of truth.
- **PARADIGM**: User wants vibespec to enable: Human defines Spec → AI writes code → Human & AI verify.
- **HUMAN_GATE**: User wants vibespec to require human approval before persisting spec changes.
- **AI_ASSIST**: User wants vibespec to leverage AI for generation, validation, and refinement.
- **SHIFT_LEFT**: User wants vibespec to catch errors at spec level, not implementation.
- **LATE_BINDING**: User wants vibespec to defer trivial technical details to implementation phase, distilling them back into specs only after code maturity.

## VISION.PHILOSOPHY

- **HUMAN_CENTRIC**: User wants vibespec to produce atomic, readable specs.
- **LLM_CENTRIC**: User wants vibespec to generate concise, deterministic prompts.
- **SYSTEM_CENTRIC**: User wants vibespec to manage complexity via scripts (see AUTOMATION.SCRIPT_FIRST).
- **SEPARATION**: User wants vibespec to strictly separate assertions from their rationale.

## VISION.AGENT_AS_DEVELOPER

- **PRIMARY_CONSUMER**: User wants vibespec to compile a "Developer's Bible" for AI agents.
- **FULL_CONTEXT**: User wants vibespec to provide AI with "God's Eye View" of internals.
- **INFORMATION_COMPLETENESS**: User wants vibespec to retain all sections for code quality.

## VISION.SPEC_STRUCTURE

- **DIRECTORY_BASED**: User wants vibespec to treat `specs/` directory as the source of truth.
- **INDIVIDUAL_FILES**: User wants vibespec to maintain separate L0-L3 files for modularity.


## VISION.FORMAL_SYNTAX

- **PRECISION_OVER_PROSE**: User wants vibespec to prioritize formal notation over prose.
- **FORMALISMS**: User wants vibespec to use Mermaid, JSON/Code schemas, pseudocode.
- **MULTIPLIER**: User wants vibespec to leverage high-density formal blocks.

## VISION.UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE

User wants vibespec to use precise, unambiguous terminology:
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Validate | Structural/static checks by scripts |
| Verify | Dynamic/runtime checks by tests |
| Assert | Hard blocking condition in code |
| Pipeline | Linear sequence of steps |
| Flow | Branching logic path |
| Violation | Breaking a spec rule |
| Error | Runtime crash or exception |
