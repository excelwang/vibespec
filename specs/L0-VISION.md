# L0: Vibespec Vision

> **Core Purpose**: User wants Vibespec to build specs that guide agents to generate user project source code with **maintainability**, **observability**, **determinism**, and **modularity**.

## Core Vision

### VISION.SCOPE

User wants vibespec to be a **specification management framework** (not a code generator).

### In-Scope
- **VAL** (Context): User wants vibespec to validate specs hierarchically (L0-L3).
- **TRACE** (Context): User wants vibespec to track layer dependencies for traceability.
- **COV** (Context): User wants vibespec to track test-to-spec coverage via `@verify_spec`.
- **IDEAS** (Context): User wants vibespec to ingest raw ideas and refine them into specs.
- **REFL** (Context): User wants vibespec to reflect on conversations and extract new ideas.
- **DEPS** (Context): User wants vibespec to operate with zero third-party dependencies.
- **AUTO** (Context): User wants vibespec to automate workflows via scripts first.
- **SKILL** (Context): User wants vibespec to distribute as an agentic skill (SKILL.md).
- **GAP** (Context): User wants vibespec to detect gaps between Idea-Spec and Spec-Code.

### Out-of-Scope
- **LLM** (Context): User does NOT want vibespec to generate code (delegated to external agents).
- **UI** (Context): User does NOT want vibespec to provide UI design tools.
- **PM** (Context): User does NOT want vibespec to manage projects or tickets.

### VISION.CODE_QUALITY_GOALS

User wants specs generated by Vibespec to guide agents to generate code with:

| Quality | Definition | Verification |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **MAINTAINABILITY** | Clarity over cleverness. Modular, readable, low coupling. | Code review, static analysis |
| **OBSERVABILITY** | If you can't see it, assume it's broken. Logs, metrics, traces. | Monitoring coverage |
| **DETERMINISM** | Stochastic behavior is a bug unless required. Reproducible results. | Test repeatability |
| **MODULARITY** | High cohesion, low coupling. Single responsibility. | Dependency analysis |

- **EXECUTION_TYPES** (Context): User wants vibespec to clearly distinguish between deterministic Scripts and stochastic Agents.

### VISION.CERTIFICATION
